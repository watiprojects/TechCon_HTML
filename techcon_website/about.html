          <h2>Our History</h2>
<p>TechCon started in 2017 with a simple goal: to bring African tech minds into one space to spark ideas, grow talent, and build the future. What began as a one-day event in Nairobi has grown into an international platform, drawing thousands of attendees from across the globe.</p>

<p>Each year, TechCon travels to a new African city, expanding its reach and spotlighting regional innovation. From mobile technology in Lagos to fintech in Kigali, TechCon evolves with the continent’s tech landscape.</p>
